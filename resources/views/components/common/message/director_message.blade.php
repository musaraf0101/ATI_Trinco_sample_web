            <h3>Director’s Message</h3>
            <p>
                After almost 12 years, I am very happy and grateful to God to rejoin the institution where I have worked as a visiting lecturer and as a senior lecturer.

                At a time when the country is struggling due to economic difficulties, there are many people who do not understand the benefit of free education. Many people are caught in a global illusion that highly paid education, is good education. A good education is not what you get by money…! It should happen through practice, effort and attraction. It should affect not only the person concerned, but also his family, community and even the country.
                <br>
                <br>
                The government has created many institutions like ours to produce healthy educators. You can get many services related to your education through this Institution. Through that, you, we and the whole country should strive to prosper.
                <br>

                As the new director of this Institute, the people of Eastern Province especially Trincomalee district and surrounding areas can use this institute to cater higher studies, if minimum three passes in G.C.E(A/L). You can choose courses in two ways and study here.

                <br>1) Free for all students and scholarships for some of them.

                <br>2) Can study on weekends for a relatively small fee.<br>

                As for Trincomalee, since tourism plays an important role in the economy, we are also reintroducing the curriculum related to tourism. There are many such courses available for free, depending on the requirements. In particular, Accounting, English and Information Technology are long-term subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                The better you use this institute, the more likely you are to advance economically.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, I pray to God to continue the services of this organization with the cooperation of all of you, and I promise to do my service efficiently.
