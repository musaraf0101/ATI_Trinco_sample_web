            <p>
                Trincomalee ATI has been progressively in existence since 1996 under the purview of SLIATE with its mission of creating excellent
                higher national diplomats with modern technology for sustainable development in a coordinated and integrated manner. It is noted
                that the ideological foundation of the institution is based on a personalized learning environment, advanced academic
                engagement, empowered educators, accountable leaders, engagement of the community, and an integration of high standards,
                curriculum, instruction, assessments, and supports. Further, the institute offers a nurturing environment meant to foster
                intellectual, emotional, and social growth. Students attending Trincomalee ATI have the unique opportunity to pursue the
                challenging academic courses like HNDA, HND in English, HNDIT, and HNDTHM; and the advanced practical training or internship
                programme that lead the students for emerging professions of the 21st century.

                <br><br>

                Moreover, the academic staff at the institute are truly committed to providing students with a quality education based on academic
                rigour and fullest support. They bring an environment with the creation, transmission, and dissemination of knowledge that
                reflects the diversity, values, skills, talents, and abilities of all the students.

                <br><br>

                Our vision is to steer the SLIATE to be best technological institute within Sri Lanka. In order to achieve our vision with rapid
                changing society and fast-changing world urges the academicians to give the right impetus for making life-long learners out of
                students. We have to be ready with sate of art labs and capacities to teach latest knowledge and develop required skills. Without
                these, our vision will only be a dream.

                <br><br>

                Finally, let me extend my best wishes to you all for both personal and professional growth and a rewarding experience during your
                tenure at the ATI, Trincomalee.
